Description: A first-person shooter game made in Unreal Engine that utilizes paintball projectiles.
  The player searches through a maze in search of multiple targets to splatter with paintballs 
  within a time limit, while using paint markings on a map to avoid getting lost. This project 
  utilized Unreal Engine 4, Visual Studio, and C++ to practice skills in 2D Graphics, Graphic 
  Interface Design, Game Engine mastery, and solving complex logic problems.
